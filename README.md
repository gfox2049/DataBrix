Fun with Hidden Markov Models

This notebook introduces the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a simple model for sequential data.

We will see:

what an HMM is and when you might want to use it;
the so-called "three problems" of an HMM; and
how to implement an HMM in PyTorch.
(The code in this notebook can also be found at https://github.com/lorenlugosch/pytorch_HMM.)

A hypothetical scenario

To motivate the use of HMMs, imagine that you have a friend who gets to do a lot of travelling. Every day, this jet-setting friend sends you a selfie from the city theyâ€™re in, to make you envious.
